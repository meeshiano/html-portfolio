<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello everyone,<BR />

    <P>I hope you're all doing well today. My name is Meesha Dubey, and I'm delighted to have the opportunity to share a bit about myself with all of you.</P>
    
    <P>First and foremost, I'm an artist at heart. Since I was young, I've found solace and joy in the world of colors and creativity. Art has always been my refuge, my escape from the everyday hustle and bustle.
    </P>
   <P> While art is more of a passion and hobby for me rather than a profession, it still holds a special place in my life. There's something magical about picking up a paintbrush or sketching pencil and letting your imagination run wild on a canvas. It's a form of self-expression that knows no bounds.
    </P>
    <P>In terms of my academic journey, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA). While my formal education lies in the realm of technology, my heart belongs to the arts. However, I've come to realize that the worlds of art and technology are not as separate as they may seem. In fact, I see them as two sides of the same coin—both avenues for creativity and innovation.
    
      <P>
    Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications, diving into the world of web development with enthusiasm and curiosity. It's a new challenge for me, but one that I'm eager to embrace. While coding and programming may be new territory, I believe that my background in art gives me a unique perspective—one that values aesthetics, creativity, and user experience.
    
    <P>
    Outside of my academic pursuits, you'll often find me in my studio, lost in the joy of creation. Whether I'm painting, sketching, or experimenting with different mediums, art is where I feel most alive.
    
    <P>
    Ultimately, I see myself as someone who straddles the worlds of art and technology—a creative soul with a passion for innovation. While art may be my hobby, it will always be an integral part of who I am.
    
    <P>
    Thank you for taking the time to listen to my story. I'm excited to get to know all of you and share this journey together.
